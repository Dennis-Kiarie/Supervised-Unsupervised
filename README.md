# Supervised-Unsupervised-Learning-Model
To implement both Supervised Learning and Unsupervised learning models.Conduct Experiment and calculate metrics.

This is a predictive data analysis to design two models i.e First model will predict individuals likely to click on  Ads from  website and the Second model will assist in classifying Kira Plastinina customerâ€™s behavior.The data used in predicting is extracted from two data sources i.e

Dataset 1 source:

http://bit.ly/IPAdvertisingData

Dataset 2 Source:

https://kiraplastinina.ru/

# Description

For part 1 we will use  a supervised learning model to help identify which individuals are most likely to click on the ads in the blog.

For part 2 we will use unsupervised learning model  i.e  K-Means clustering vs Hierarchical clustering.
